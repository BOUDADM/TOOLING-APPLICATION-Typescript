## Introduction

The "ID_PINGER" project is a small-scale application designed to facilitate secure message transfer between a provider and a proxy  

while ensuring the integrity of the encryption process. It serves as a crucial component in a larger communication system where data  

confidentiality and authenticity are paramount. 

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the "ID_PINGER" project is to establish a secure method for sharing the shift value used in encryption between  

the provider and the proxy. By generating a secure index based on time and utilizing a custom encryption algorithm, the project ensures  

that the shift value remains confidential and tamper-proof during message transmission. 

## Features 

1. Custom Hash Function: Utilizes a custom hash function to generate a secure index based on the current time (hour and minute). 

2. Encryption Algorithm: Implements a custom encryption algorithm to encrypt words using a variable shift value. 

3. Secure Message Transfer: Ensures secure message transfer by encrypting words with a dynamically generated shift  

value and securely sharing the shift value between the provider and the proxy. 

4. Error Handling: Provides error handling mechanisms to handle out-of-bounds secure index and invalid inputs. 


## Components 

1. EncryptionAPI Class: Encapsulates the encryption and decryption functionality within a class, allowing for easy integration  

into larger systems. 

2. Main Application: Contains the main execution logic, including secure index generation, word encryption, and determination of the shift value by the proxy. 

  

## Usage 

The "ID_PINGER" project can be integrated into communication systems where secure message transfer between a provider and a proxy is required. 

By utilizing the provided EncryptionAPI class, developers can easily incorporate the secure encryption and decryption functionality into their applications. 

  

## Security Considerations 

1. Confidentiality: Ensures the confidentiality of the shift value used in encryption by dynamically generating a secure index based on time. 

2. Integrity: Maintains the integrity of the encryption process by securely sharing the shift value between the provider and the proxy. 

3. Authentication: Provides a mechanism for the proxy to authenticate the received message by determining the correct shift value. 

  

## Future Enhancements 

1. Enhanced Error Handling: Implement additional error handling mechanisms to handle edge cases and improve robustness. 

2. Performance Optimization: Optimize the code for better performance, especially in scenarios with large datasets or high message transfer rates. 

3. Integration with Larger Systems: Develop integrations with larger communication systems and protocols to facilitate seamless message transfer. 

  

## Conclusion 

The "ID_PINGER" project serves as a foundational component in ensuring secure message transfer between entities in communication systems.  

By leveraging custom encryption algorithms and secure index generation techniques, it provides a robust solution for maintaining confidentiality and authenticity in data transmission.
